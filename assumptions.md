For auth.py:
- Assumed that the auth_user_id is the placement of that particular user in the users list upon registration, ie. the first registered user has the user id of 1 as it is the first element in the list.
- Assumed that the inputed lastname and firstname can contain any character and doesn't necessarily have to be letters, eg. the firstname can be $%^^&&* and the lastname can be (tommy)*** as long as it satisfies the length requirements.
- Assumed that the password can contain any character and it can be of any length as long as it's greater than or equal to 6 characters, eg. the password can be 50 characters long and can contain special characters in it as well.
